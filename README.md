## üßæ **Departmental Store Sales Dashboard (Python + Excel) ‚Äî Project Report**

**Objective:**
To simulate and visualize 3-year sales data (2022‚Äì2024) for departmental stores across Kolkata using Python-generated data and Excel-based reporting, designed for Sales Supervisors and Product Managers.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Generation & Business Understanding

As an Economics graduate, I began by understanding the **consumption basket of West Bengal households** and analyzing real-world **departmental store operations**. I identified common transactional attributes: product category, item names, pricing bands, payment methods, and regional sales distinctions.

Using **Python**, I generated a **hypothetical sales dataset** covering 3,300+ daily transactions. The following Python libraries were used:

* `pandas` ‚Äì data frame construction
* `numpy` ‚Äì randomization and pricing logic
* `random` ‚Äì simulating salespersons, categories, products
* `datetime` ‚Äì date ranges
* `openpyxl` / `xlsxwriter` ‚Äì Excel file export

The dataset included fields like `Date`, `Store Location`, `Sales Rep`, `Product Category`, `Unit Price`, `Quantity`, `Payment Method`, etc.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Design (Excel)

Built a fully interactive, filterable dashboard in Excel using:

* **PivotTables** ‚Äì core metrics (KPIs, region/category/rep/product sales)
* **Charts** ‚Äì trend lines, bar graphs, donut chart (payment mix)
* **INDEX/MATCH** ‚Äì to dynamically identify highest sold category, product, and top rep
* **Slicers** ‚Äì for Year and Quarter filters (synchronized across visuals)
* **Conditional Formatting** ‚Äì color-coded KPIs and charts for visual clarity

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges Faced & Business Gaps Identified

| Area                 | Challenge                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                         |
| **Regional Gap**     | South Kolkata lags behind (‚Çπ‚ÄØ23.8‚ÄØM vs. ‚Çπ‚ÄØ27.4‚ÄØM in North). Needs **targeted promotions and SKU realignment**.                                                                                                    |
| **Temporal Drop**    | Revenue dip observed in Q4 2024 (‚Çπ‚ÄØ79.5‚ÄØL). Indicates **weak festive strategies** or **clearance stock inefficiencies**.                                                                                          |
| **Sales Rep Gaps**   | Wide productivity range: SP013 (‚Çπ‚ÄØ7.1k avg) vs. SP015 (‚Çπ‚ÄØ4.3k). Suggests **uneven territory allocation/training gaps**.                                                                                           |
| **SKU Inefficiency** | Over 20 SKUs sold <‚ÄØ700 units. Calls for **SKU optimization** to avoid inventory waste.                                                                                                                           |
| **Payment Handling** | The store sees an imbalanced payment distribution: Digital payment (67%), and Cash (33%). A significant skewness has been observed toward digital payment, suggesting an opportunity to promote digital wallet    |                              incentives. **Digital wallet incentive schemes** can increase adoption.                                                                                                                                        |
